<p>Ebola virus (EBOV) is a highly virulent zoonotic pathogen responsible for numerous outbreaks, with over 25 documented to dateâ€”most of which have occurred in Central Africa. The rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (ERVEBO), a live attenuated formulation, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for EBOV prevention. However, due to the limitations associated with live attenuated vaccines, multi-epitope vaccines are considered potentially safer alternatives.In this study, we utilized immunoinformatics approaches to design a multi-epitope vaccine targeting EBOV. Protein sequences of VP35, VP24, VP30, VP40, GP, and NP were retrieved from the NCBI database. T-cell and linear B-cell epitopes were predicted from these target proteins and screened for their antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and sequence conservancy. The selected epitopes were assembled into a single vaccine construct using suitable linkers. Additionally, the 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 (Locus RL7 MYCTU) was incorporated at the N-terminal as an adjuvant.Physicochemical analysis confirmed that the designed vaccine possessed favorable antigenic and non-allergenic properties. A 3D structure of the vaccine was modeled, refined, and validated. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated a strong and stable interaction between the vaccine and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Furthermore, codon optimization and in silico cloning indicated efficient expression of the vaccine in *Escherichia coli* (E. coli).Overall, the findings suggest that the designed vaccine holds significant promise; however, experimental studies are required to validate its efficacy and safety
